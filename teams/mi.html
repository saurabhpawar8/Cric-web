        The Mumbai Indians are a franchise cricket team based in Mumbai, Maharashtra, that competes in the Indian
        Premier League. Founded in 2008, the team is owned by India's biggest conglomerate, Reliance Industries, through
        its 100% subsidiary IndiaWin Sports. Since its establishment, the team has played its home matches in the
        33,108-capacity Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai.

        In 2017, the Mumbai Indians became the first franchise to cross the $100 million mark in brand value among the
        IPL franchises.[3] The brand value of Mumbai Indians, in 2019, is estimated to be around â‚¹809 crore (roughly
        $115 million), the highest among all the IPL franchises for the fourth consecutive year.[4]
